# Plot.ly Homework - Belly Button Biodiversity

In this assignment, students are required to build an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## Homework Requirements

1. Populate a dropdown menu with all of the Sample ID's. When an option is selected, this will update all of the charts.

2. Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.

3. Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.

4. Display sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.

	* Display each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page.

5. Update all of the plots any time that a new sample is selected.

Additionally, you are welcome to create any layout that you would like for your dashboard. An example dashboard is shown below:

## Advanced Challenge Assignment (Optional)

The following task is advanced and therefore optional.

* Adapt the Gauge Chart from <https://plot.ly/javascript/gauge-charts/> to plot the weekly washing frequency of the individual.

* Update the chart whenever a new sample is selected.
